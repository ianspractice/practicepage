        <h4>Remember, this is a personal preference</h4>
        <p>I'm from Uruguay and I have traveled to many countries.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uruguay (of course)</li>
            <li>Argentina</li>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>Canada</li>
            <li>Spain</li>
            <li>Switzerland</li>
            <li>Italy</li>
            <li>Germany</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That being said, this is my personal top 5 most beautiful places that I have visited:</p>
        <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Zs3GvxcnNEmZhDPY6">Fuji Five Lakes Area</a><br>
                <img src="fuji.jpg" alt="Mount Fuji" width="25%"><br>
                <p>One of the most iconic places in the world, and one of my favorite places. It's a peaceful place, and
                    I highly recommend going if you visit Tokyo.</p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/RkZTw5Dqoah5v4Ay5">Swiss Alps</a><br>
                <img src="SwissAlps.jpg" alt="Swiss Alps" width="25%"><br>
                <p>As you might notice, I love mountains, so the Swiss Alps have to be in my top list. Probably one of
                    the most beautiful views in the world.</p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/35FPndqBTkdaqEaN8">7 Lakes, Bariloche</a><br>
                <img src="Bariloche.jpg" alt="Bariloche, 7 Lakes" width="25%"><br>
                <p>The 7 lakes of Bariloche have beautiful clear water and amazing views of the mountains.</p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/iwA5Rm2gghFyTPR79">Iguazu Falls</a><br>
                <img src="Iguazu.jpg" alt="Iguazu Falls Argentina" width="25%"><br>
                <p>Iguazu Falls is probably the most amazing thing I have seen in my life. It's such a magical place.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/45hnsUqHM5EZ6vaR8">The Rambla of Montevideo</a><br>
                <img src="RamblaOfMontevideo.jpg" alt="Rambla de Montevideo" width="25%"><br>
                <p>This is my top one place in the world. Probably it's not the most epic or beautiful of the top, but
                    it's my favorite because I was born there. There are all my memories.</p>
                <p>Going there to drink some mates with my friends, watch the sunset, go with my dog, my first
                    kissâ€”everything that I lived there makes this place so special for me. Because beautiful places are
                    not just about views or something like that.</p>
                <p>Beautiful places are those that you build in your life, and those that make you happy.</p>
